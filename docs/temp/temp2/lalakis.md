:memo: [Solution Snippet](#the-cat-command)

#### The cat Command

The `cat` command is probably the most widely used command in Linux. This command can be used to read and con**cat**enate files (this feature gives the command its name), writing its contents to the standard output.

##### Displaying File Contents

The most common usage of the cat command is to read the contents of files.

For example, the following command will display the contents of the `/etc/readme.txt` file in the terminal:

```shell
# Display the contents of /etc/readme.txt file in the terminal
cat /etc/issue
```
